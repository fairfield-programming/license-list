{"id":"ms-rl","name":"Microsoft Reciprocal License","creator":[],"since":"","description":"Microsoft Reciprocal License (Ms-RL) is a permissive open-source software license that allows developers to use, modify, and distribute the licensed software without any limitations. However, if you distribute any software that includes or depends on the Ms-RL licensed code, you must also make the source code of your software available under the Ms-RL. The Ms-RL is a popular license among Microsoft's open-source projects, including the ASP.NET web framework and the IronPython programming language. The Ms-RL is based on the popular Mozilla Public License (MPL) and is compatible with other open-source licenses such as the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the Apache License. The license requires that any modifications to the licensed code must be released under the same license terms. Additionally, the license requires that any notices, copyrights, and trademarks must be preserved in the modified code. One of the main benefits of the Ms-RL is that it encourages community participation and collaboration by allowing developers to use, modify, and distribute the licensed code freely. The license also promotes innovation by allowing developers to build upon existing open-source software, making it easier to develop new applications and services. The Ms-RL also helps to reduce the cost of software development by providing access to high-quality open-source code. However, there are some drawbacks to using the Ms-RL. For example, the requirement to make source code available under the Ms-RL may discourage some developers from using the licensed code. This requirement can also create complications when integrating Ms-RL licensed code with proprietary code. Additionally, the license may not be suitable for some commercial applications, as the requirement to release source code may conflict with proprietary software licensing models. Overall, the Ms-RL is a permissive open-source license that promotes collaboration and innovation by allowing developers to use, modify, and distribute licensed code freely. However, the requirement to release source code under the same license terms may not be suitable for all software projects, particularly those with proprietary components. As with any software license, it is important to carefully evaluate the license terms and consult with legal counsel before using the Ms-RL in a software project.","permissions":["distribution"],"conditions":[],"limitations":[],"body":"This license governs use of the accompanying software.
